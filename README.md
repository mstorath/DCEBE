# Bolus arrival time estimation for DCE-MRI signals (DCEBE)

## Description
This Matlab code estimates the bolus arrival time (BAT) of DCE-MRI signals.
It is particularly intended to work with signals that do not have a fast upslope
as it is often the case for data of small animals.
The proposed method employs a spline-based approximation model.
Parameter estimation is done by generalized cross validation.

A detailed documentation of the method is given in
the paper A. Bendinger, C. Debus, C. Glowa, C. Karger, J. Peter, M. Storath,
